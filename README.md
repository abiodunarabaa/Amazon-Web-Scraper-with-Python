# Amazon Web Scraper with Python

The project aims to develop a web scraping tool using Python to extract product information from Amazon's website.
Leveraging the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, the scraper retrieves data such as product title, price, rating, and number of reviews from Amazon product pages.

The script starts by sending a GET request to a specified Amazon product URL. It then parses the HTML content of the page using BeautifulSoup,
allowing it to locate and extract relevant product details. Key information, including the product title, price, rating, and number of reviews,
is extracted from the HTML structure of the page.

The extracted data is then displayed to the user, providing valuable insights into the specified Amazon product. The script can be easily customized
to scrape data from various Amazon product pages by providing different URLs as input.

This project is useful for individuals interested in monitoring product prices, ratings, and reviews on Amazon. 
It provides a simple yet effective solution for extracting valuable product information from Amazon's vast online marketplace.
